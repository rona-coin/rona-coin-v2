## About This Source Code
This project is structured around Node JS and Truffle. A solidity pragma of `^0.8.4` is used for all smart contract source code. The `Byzantium` build of SolC version `^0.8.4`, locally installed on a Windows 10 Pro machine, was used for all smart contract compilation for both the BSC Testnet and Mainnet.

This project's Node JS `package.json` configuration file can be found in its standard location at the root of the source directory. This project relies on the the following Node JS dependencies:
* `@truffle/hdwallet-provider ^01.4.0`
* `solc ^0.8.4`
* `truffle ^5.3.8`
* `web3 ^1.3.6`

This project's `package.json` also specifies a compile script to ensure stable and normal solidity compilation.
